# Overview of the project
This project is about a smart water system designed by using Raspberry PI 2 platform as a medium of the data transmission. 
The Raspberry Pi 2 board is connected to a sensor that can monitor and collect real world data. In order to meet the standard of industry 
4.0, the use internet of things (IoT) is implemented to capture and analyse the real-world information. This project is aimed to be 
implemented to detect excessive river water that can eventually lead to flooding at some areas. In the real world situation, this project 
is targeted to be placed under the bridges along the river to collect the data. But in this project, the sensor is placed on top of a water 
tank to collect the data. The data that is collected will be sent to cloud processing system and the program in the cloud will analyse the 
data to provide results.
