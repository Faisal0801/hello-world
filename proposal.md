# Overview of the project
> This project is about a pizza delivery system. Online pizza ordering services are websites that feature interactive menus allowing customers to place orders with local restaurants and food cooperatives. Much like ordering consumer goods online, many of these allow customers to keep accounts with them in order to make frequent ordering convenient. A customer will search for a favourite restaurant, choose from available items, and choose delivery or pickup. Payment can be amongst others by credit card or cash, with the restaurant returning a percentage to the online food company.

Manual system involves paper work in the form of maintaining various files and manuals. Maintaining
critical information in the files and manuals is full of risk and a tedious process. Including a framework, showing how to apply (nternet technology progressively as skills and confidence grow, the pro#ect demonstrates the route from adapting materials to developing an online environment. Nowadays people don't have much time to spend in restaurant by #ust there and waiting for the waiter to take their order. Many customer visits the restaurant in their lunch break and recess so they have limited time to eat and return to the respective office and colleges. So, this software helps them to save time and order food whenever they want without calling the waiter again and again.
