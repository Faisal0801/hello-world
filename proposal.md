# Overview of the project
> This project is about a smart water system designed by using Raspberry PI 2 platform as a medium of the data transmission. The Raspberry Pi 2 board is connected to a sensor that can monitor and collect real world data. This project is aimed to be implemented to detect excessive river water that can eventually lead to flooding at some areas. In the real world situation, this project is targeted to be placed under the bridges along the river to collect the data. However, in this project, the sensors are placed on top of a water tank to collect the data. The sensors will be use are temperature sensor, water level sensor, and humidity sonsor. The data that is collected will be sent to cloud processing system and the program in the cloud will analyse the data to provide results. The result will be display in graph and table.
